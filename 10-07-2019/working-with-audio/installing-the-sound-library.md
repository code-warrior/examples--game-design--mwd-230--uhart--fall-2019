# Installing the Sound Library

1. In the file menus, click `Sketch` | `Import Library...` | `Add Library...`
2. Search for “sound” and click on the library authored by The Processing Foundation.
3. Click “Install” at the bottom.
4. A green, round check mark should appear under “status” on the left in the Contribution Manager.
5. Check `~/Documents/Processing/libraries/` for a folder called “sound”. (In Windows, the folder should be `Document/Processing/libraries`.)
6. If Processing is running, restart it.
